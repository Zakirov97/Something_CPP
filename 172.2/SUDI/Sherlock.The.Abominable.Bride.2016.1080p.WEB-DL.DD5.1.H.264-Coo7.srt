1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,320
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the
address is 221B Baker Street.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,720
Afternoon.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He's always like that.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,840
WHIPS AND POUNDS

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,360
Bad day was it?

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,720
Since yesterday you've moved in with
him and now you're solving crimes
together.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,480
Mwah! Look at you, all happy,
it's not decent.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,200
Who cares about decent?
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,080
Don't make people into heroes, John.
Heroes don't exist and, if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,320
I will burn the HEART out of you.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,560
Right, this should do it.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,240
Are you wearing any pants?
No. OK.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,960
THEY CHUCKLE

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,680
This is how I want you to
remember me, the woman who beat you.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,720
But there never was any monster.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,000
HOWLING

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,240
Sherlock?
Here we are, at last.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,680
Argh!
GUNSHOT

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Goodbye, John. Sherlock!
'Those things will kill you.'

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,320
Oh, you bastard!

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,160
The thrill of the chase, the blood
pumping through your veins,

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,560
just the two of us
against the rest of the world.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,160
Wait!

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,080
We're going to need to coordinate.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,880
I asked you for one more miracle.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,280
I asked you to stop being dead.
I heard you.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,920
Shut up! You are not a
puzzle solver, you never have been.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
You're a drama queen!

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
Now there is
a man in there about to die.

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,840
The game is on, solve it!

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,240
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,400
No chance for you to be a hero
this time, Mr Holmes.

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm a high-functioning sociopath!

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,560
GUNSHOT

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,600
There is no prison in which we could
incarcerate Sherlock without

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,840
causing a riot on a daily basis.

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,680
The alternative, however,
would require your approval.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
To the very best of times, John.

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,200
WOMAN'S VOICE: Did you miss me?

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,720
DISTORTED VOICE: Did you miss me?

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,840
How is this possible?

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,320
How is the exile going?
I've only been gone four minutes.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,720
Well, I certainly hope
you've learnt your lesson.

45
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,040
Who needs me this time?

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
Miss me?

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,480
England.

48
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,520
SHELL WHINES

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
"The Second Afghan War brought
honours and promotion to many.

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,240
"But, for me, it meant nothing
but misfortune and disaster."

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
HE GROANS

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,040
HE MOANS

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
All right, Captain.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,760
WAR CRIES

55
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,480
"I returned to England
with my health irretrievably ruined

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,520
"and my future bleak.

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,680
"Under such circumstances,
I naturally gravitated to London.

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,440
"That great cesspool into which
all the loungers..."

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Watson! "..and idlers of the empire
are drained."

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,280
Watson!

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,760
Stamford.

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
Remember?

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,520
We were at Barts together.

64
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,600
Yes, of course. Stamford.

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,840
Good Lord! Where have you been?

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
You're as thin as a rake!

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,720
I made it home.
Many weren't so lucky.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,640
So what now?

69
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,840
I need a place to live.

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Somewhere decent at an affordable
price. It's not easy.

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,320
STAMFORD CHUCKLES

72
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,720
You know, you're the second person
to say that to me today.

73
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
Hmm? Who was the first?

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
POUNDING

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,680
Good Lord.

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,560
It's an experiment, apparently.

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,720
Beating corpses to establish how
long after death bruising is

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
still possible.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
Is there a medical point to that?

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,520
Not sure.

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Neither am I. So,
where's this friend of yours, then?

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,680
POUNDING CONTINUES

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Excuse me.

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,800
I do hope we're not interrupting.

85
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,520
You've been in Afghanistan,
I perceive.

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,960
Dr Watson, Mr Sherlock...

87
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,840
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

88
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm sorry...?

89
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,280
I have my eye on a suite of rooms
near Regent's Park. Between us
we could afford them.

90
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,000
Rooms?
Who said anything about rooms?

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,960
I did, I mentioned it this morning,
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,880
Now he appears after lunch in the
company of a man of military aspect

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,000
with a tan
and a recent injury, both suggestive

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,120
of the campaign in Afghanistan
and an enforced departure from it.

95
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,680
The conclusion seemed inescapable.
We'll finalise the details
tomorrow evening.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
Now, if you'll excuse me,

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
I have a hanging in Wandsworth and
I'd hate them to start without me.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,680
A hanging?
I take a professional interest.

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,120
I also play the violin and smoke a
pipe. I presume that's not a problem.

100
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,360
Er, no, well... And you're clearly
acclimatized to never getting

101
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,000
to the end of a sentence.
We'll get along splendidly.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
Tomorrow evening,
seven o'clock, then.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,560
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,040
and the address is
221B, Baker Street.

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,320
Yes...he's always been like that.

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
Papers! Papers!

107
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,480
Papers! Papers!

108
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,760
CAROL SINGING IN BACKGROUND

109
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,960
Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle
doing? Very popular, Dr Watson.

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,240
Is there going to be a proper
murder next month?

111
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,320
I'll have a word with
the criminal classes.

112
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,480
If you wouldn't mind.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,760
Is that him? Is he in there?

114
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
THUD
Ow! No.

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,920
No, no, not at all.
Er, good day to you.

116
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,000
Let on, walk.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Merry Christmas, Mr Holmes!

118
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,680
Mr Holmes!

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,840
I do wish you'd let me know
when you're planning to come home!

120
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,080
I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson.

121
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,840
That's the trouble with
dismembered country squires.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
They're notoriously difficult
to schedule.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,760
What's in there? Never mind.

124
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,200
Thank you.

125
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,880
Did you catch the murderer,
Mr Holmes?

126
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
Caught the murderer,
still looking for the legs.
I think we'll call it a draw.

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,920
And I noticed you've published
another of your stories, Dr Watson.

128
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,880
Yes, did you enjoy it?

129
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,640
No.

130
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,040
Oh?

131
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,160
I never enjoy them.
Why not?

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Well, I never say anything, do I?

133
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,240
According to you,
I just show people up the stairs

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
and serve you breakfasts.

135
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,840
Well, within the narrative, that is,
broadly speaking, your function.

136
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,640
My what?!

137
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Don't feel singled out, Mrs Hudson,
I'm hardly in the dog one.
"The dog one?"

138
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm your landlady,
not a plot device.

139
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,760
Do you mean
The Hound Of The Baskervilles?

140
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,400
And you make the rooms
so drab and dingy.

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh, blame it on the illustrator,
he's out of control!

142
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,480
I've had to grow this moustache
just so people will recognise me.

143
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,080
"Over the many years
it has been my privilege to record

144
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,560
"the exploits of my remarkable
friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes,

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,240
"it has sometimes been difficult to
choose which of his many

146
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,480
"cases to set before my readers.

147
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,520
"Some are still too
sensitive to recount,

148
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,680
"whilst others are too
recent in the minds of the public.

149
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,240
"But in all our many adventures
together, no case pushed my friend

150
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,480
"to such mental and physical
extremes

151
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,320
"as that of The Abominable Bride!"

152
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Good Lord!

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,800
Mrs Hudson, there is
a woman in my sitting room!

154
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Is it intentional?

155
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,080
She's a client. Said you were out,
insisted on waiting.

156
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
Would you, er, care to sit down?

157
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,800
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

158
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
You ask her!

159
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,760
Why didn't YOU ask her?

160
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,560
How could I, what with me
not talking and everything?!

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh, for God's sake,
give her some lines,

162
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,760
she's perfectly
capable of starving us!

163
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,600
Good afternoon.
I am Sherlock Holmes, this is
my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.

164
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,800
You may speak freely in front of him,
as he rarely understands a word.
Holmes!

165
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,680
However, before you do, allow me
to make some trifling observations.

166
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
You have an impish sense of humour,

167
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,840
which currently you are deploying to
ease a degree of personal anguish.

168
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,800
You have recently married a man
of a seemingly kindly disposition,

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
who has now abandoned you

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,720
for an unsavoury companion
of dubious morals.

171
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,160
You have come to this agency
as a last resort,

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
in the hope that reconciliation
may still be possible.

173
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
Good Lord, Holmes!

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,960
All of this is, of course,
perfectly evident from your perfume.

175
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,240
Her perfume?

176
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,560
Yes, her perfume, which brings
insight to me and disaster to you.

177
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
How so?

178
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,040
Because I recognised it
and you did not.

179
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Mary! John.

180
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,360
Why, in God's name,
are you pretending to be a client?

181
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,160
Because I could think of no other
way to see my husband, husband.

182
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,880
VIOLIN PLAYS

183
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,080
It was an affair of international
intrigue.

184
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,560
It was a murdered country squire.
Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

185
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,240
I don't mind you going, my darling,
I mind you leaving me behind.
But what could you do?!

186
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,880
Well, what do you do,
except wander around taking notes,
looking surprised?!

187
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
VIOLIN SCREECHES
Enough!

188
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
The stage is set, the curtain rises.

189
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
We are ready to begin.

190
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
Begin what?

191
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,080
Sometimes to solve a case,
one must first solve another.

192
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh, you have a case, then,
a new one? An old one, very old.

193
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,160
I shall have to go deep.

194
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,880
Deep? Into what?

195
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
Myself.

196
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,920
Lestrade! Do stop loitering
by the door and come in.

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,680
How did you know it was me?

198
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,840
The regulation tread is
unmistakable.

199
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,440
Lighter than Jones,
heavier than Gregson.

200
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
I, I just came up... Mrs Hudson
didn't seem to be talking.

201
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,320
I fear she has
branched into literary criticism

202
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
by means of satire.

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,640
It is a distressing trend
in the modern landlady.

204
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,040
What brings you here
in your off-duty hours?

205
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,920
How do you know I'm off duty?
Well, since your arrival,

206
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,840
you've addressed over 40%
of your remarks to my decanter.

207
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,200
Watson, give the Inspector
what he so clearly wants.

208
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,840
So...Lestrade,
what can we do for you?

209
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,320
Oh, I'm not here on business,
I just thought I'd drop by.

210
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,560
A social call?

211
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,280
Yeah, of course, just to wish you
the compliments of the season.

212
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,160
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

213
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,520
Thank God that's over.

214
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,160
Now, Inspector,
what strange happening compels you

215
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
to my door,
but embarrasses you to relate?

216
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Who said anything happened?

217
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,400
You did. By every means
short of actual speech.

218
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,520
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Holmes,
you have misdiagnosed.

219
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,880
Then, correct me, Doctor.

220
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,880
He didn't WANT a drink,
he needed one.

221
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,640
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

222
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,200
My Boswell is learning.
They do grow up so fast.

223
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
Watson, restore
the courage of Scotland Yard.

224
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Inspector, do sit down.

225
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,400
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.

226
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,720
Fear is wisdom in the face
of danger,

227
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,400
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,960
Thank you.

229
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,640
From the beginning, then.

230
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,240
BANG

231
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,840
BULLETS WHISTLE

232
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
You!

233
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,520
No, please!

234
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
You?!

235
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,360
GUNSHOTS

236
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
A moment.

237
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,960
GUNSHOT

238
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,800
When was this?

239
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
Yesterday morning.

240
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,400
The bride's face,
how was it described?

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,200
"White as death,
mouth like a crimson wound."

242
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,200
Poetry or truth?

243
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,640
Many would say
they're the same thing.

244
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?

245
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,000
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
After what?

247
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,880
You?

248
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,200
Or me?

249
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
GUNSHOT

250
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,600
SCREAMING

251
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows
her own brains out in public

252
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,920
and you need help identifying
the guilty party?

253
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,640
I feel Scotland Yard has
reached a new low.

254
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,120
That's not why I'm here.

255
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,160
I surmised.
What was her name, the bride?

256
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,000
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her
wedding anniversary.

257
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,160
The police, of course, were called.

258
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,720
And her body taken to the morgue.

259
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,800
Standard procedure. Why are you
telling us what may be presumed?

260
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,960
Because of what happened next.

261
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,440
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

262
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,480
CHURCH BELLS TOLL

263
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,120
Thomas Ricoletti.
Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

264
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Presumably on his way to the morgue
to identify her remains?

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,280
As it turned out,
he was saved the trip.

266
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,720
HORSES WHINNY

267
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,160
# Do not forget me

268
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,400
# Do not forget me

269
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,280
# Remember the maid... #

270
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,680
Who are you?

271
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,760
# The maid of the mill... #

272
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Why are you doing this?
Just tell me who you are!

273
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,880
You recognise our song, my dear?

274
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,360
I sang it at our wedding.

275
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,080
HE SHIVERS
Emelia?

276
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,440
You, you're dead,
you can't be here, you died!

277
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,080
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

278
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,520
As beautiful as the day
you married me?

279
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,160
Who...

280
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,800
What the hell is all this about?!

281
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,520
What does it look like,
my handsome friend?

282
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,880
It's a shotgun wedding.

283
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
GUNSHOT

284
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,960
THUD

285
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,680
Till death us do part.
Twice in this case.

286
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,880
SCREAMING

287
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,640
HE BLOWS WHISTLE

288
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
Extraordinary.

289
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,000
Impossible.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
Superb.

291
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,680
Suicide as street theatre, murder by
corpse. Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

292
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,240
Watson, your hat and coat. Where are
we going? To the morgue.

293
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,560
There's not a moment to lose, which
one can so rarely say of a morgue.

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
And am I just to sit here?

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,640
Not at all, my dear.
We'll be hungry later.

296
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,160
Holmes, just one thing,
tweeds in a morgue?

297
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,680
Needs must when the devil drives,
Watson.

298
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
Ma'am.

299
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm part of a campaign, you know.

300
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,800
Oh, campaign?

301
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,920
Votes for women.

302
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,640
And are you for or against?

303
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,080
Get out.

304
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,760
SHE SIGHS

305
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,920
DOOR KNOCKS

306
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,480
Ooh-ooh!

307
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,800
Oh,
have they gone off again, have they?

308
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,280
I don't know,
what a life those gentlemen lead.

309
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,320
Huh, yes. Those gentlemen(!)

310
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
Oh, never you mind.

311
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,160
Oh, almost forgot, that came for you.

312
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Oh.

313
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,080
Mrs Hudson,
tell my husband I'll be home late,

314
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,360
I have some urgent business.

315
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
Is everything all right?

316
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,200
Oh, you know, just a, er,
friend in need.

317
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,880
Oh, dear. What friend?

318
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,680
England.

319
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,080
Well, that's not very specific.

320
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,080
Who's on mortuary duty?

321
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,520
You know who.

322
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Always him.

323
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,120
HORSE NEIGHS

324
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,240
Please tell me which idiot did this!

325
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,960
It's for everyone's safety.

326
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,440
This woman is dead,
half her head is missing.

327
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,480
She's not a threat to anyone.

328
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,320
Tell that to her husband,
he's under a sheet over there.

329
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,760
Whatever happened in Limehouse
last night, I think

330
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,320
we can safely assume it wasn't
the work of a dead woman.

331
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,760
Stranger things have happened.

332
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,680
Such as...?

333
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,040
Well... Strange things.

334
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,520
You're speaking like a child.

335
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,960
This is clearly man's work.
Where is he?

336
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,000
DOOR OPENS

337
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,000
Holmes.

338
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,600
Hooper.

339
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
You, back to work!

340
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,360
So, come to astonish us
with your magic tricks, I suppose?

341
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,760
Is there anything to which you
would like to draw my attention?

342
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Nothing at all, Mr Holmes.

343
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,720
You may leave any time you like.

344
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,760
Dr Hooper, I asked
Mr Holmes to come here. Cooperate.

345
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,200
That's an order.

346
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,440
There are two
"features of interest",

347
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,680
as you are always
saying in Dr Watson's stories.

348
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,000
I never say that.

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,920
You do, actually, quite a lot.

350
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,840
First of all,
this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

351
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,160
She has been categorically
identified.

352
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,440
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

353
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,360
Then who was that in Limehouse
last night?

354
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

355
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,200
It can't have been.
She was dead, she was here.

356
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,520
She was positively identified by her
own husband, seconds before he died.

357
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,320
He had no reason to lie,
could hardly have been mistaken.

358
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,160
The cabbie knew her, too,
there's no question it's her.

359
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,000
But she can't have been in two
places at the same time, can she?

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
No, Watson, one place is strictly
the limit for the recently deceased.

361
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Holmes!
CLICKS FINGERS

362
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,920
Could it have been twins?
No. Why not?

363
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,680
Because it's never twins.

364
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,960
Emelia was not a twin,
nor did she have any sisters.

365
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,600
She had one older brother
who died four years ago.

366
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,480
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

367
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,120
A what?!

368
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,520
A secret twin.

369
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
Hmm? You know?

370
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,720
A twin that nobody knows about.

371
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,680
This whole thing could have
been planned.

372
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,120
Since the moment of conception.
How breathtakingly prescient of her.

373
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,040
It is never twins, Watson!
Then what's your theory?

374
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,600
More to the point,
what's your problem?

375
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,200
I, I don't understand...
Why were you so frightened?

376
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,680
Nothing so far has justified
your assault on my decanter,

377
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,520
and why have you allowed a dead
woman to be placed under arrest?

378
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,240
Ah, that would be the other
feature of interest.

379
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,040
A smear of blood on her finger.

380
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,640
That could have happened
any number of ways.

381
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
Indeed. There's one other thing.

382
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,400
It wasn't there earlier.

383
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
Neither was that.

384
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,480
You!

385
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,160
You?

386
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,960
You?!

387
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,760
Holmes?

388
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,120
Gun in the mouth,
a bullet through the brain...

389
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
Back of the head blown clean off.

390
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
How could he survive?

391
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,600
"She", you mean.

392
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
I'm sorry?

393
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
Not "he", "she".

394
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,720
Yes, yes of course.

395
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,400
HE STARTS

396
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,480
Well, thank you all
for a fascinating case.

397
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,600
I'll send you a telegram
when I've solved it. Watson.

398
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,560
The gunshot wound was obviously
the cause of death,

399
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,040
but there are clear
indicators of consumption.

400
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,520
It might be worth a postmortem.

401
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,560
We need all the information
we can get.

402
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,240
Oh, isn't he observant,
now that Daddy's gone(!)

403
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,640
I AM observant in some ways, just
as Holmes is quite blind in others.

404
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
Really?

405
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,360
Yes, really.

406
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,520
Amazing...what one has to do to get
ahead in a man's world.

407
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,120
What's he saying that for?

408
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,520
Get back to work!

409
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,760
Well, Holmes?
Surely you must have some theory?

410
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,160
Not yet. These are deep waters,
Watson, deep waters.

411
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
And I shall have to go deeper still.

412
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
"It was not for several months
that we were to pick up

413
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
"the threads of this strange
case again.

414
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,560
"And then under very unexpected
circumstances."

415
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,600
Five of them now, all the same,
every one of them.

416
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,240
Hush, please, this is
a matter of supreme importance.

417
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,080
What is?
The obliquity of the ecliptic.
I have to understand it.

418
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
What is it? I don't know, I'm still
trying to understand it.

419
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,200
I thought you understood everything.
Of course not, that would be an
appalling waste of brain space.

420
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,320
I specialise. And what's so important
about this? What's so important
about five boring murders?

421
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
They're not boring. Five men dead,
murdered in their own homes,
rice on the floor

422
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
like at a wedding, and the word
"You" written in blood on the wall!

423
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,600
It's, it's her, it's the Bride.
Somehow she's risen again.

424
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
Solved it.
You can't have solved it!

425
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
Of course I've solved it,
it's perfectly simple.

426
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,000
The incident of the mysterious
Mrs Ricoletti, the killer from

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,840
beyond the grave, has been widely
reported in the popular press.

428
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,560
Now people are disguising their own
dull little murders as the

429
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,720
work of a ghost, to confuse the
impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

430
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,280
There you are, solved.

431
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,160
Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way
out, she likes to feel involved.

432
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,000
You sure?

433
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,880
Certainly. Go away. Watson!
I'm ready.

434
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,520
Your hat and boots,
we have an important appointment.

435
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,920
Didn't Dr Watson move out
a few months ago?

436
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
He did, didn't he?

437
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,640
Who have I been talking to
all this time?

438
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,840
Well, speaking on behalf of the
impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

439
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,080
that chair is definitely empty.

440
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,080
It is, isn't it?
Works surprisingly well, though.

441
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,600
I actually thought he was improving.

442
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,120
HE EXHALES

443
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,440
Ah. Where have you been?

444
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,640
Sorry, sir, I'm rather
behind my time this morning.

445
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,480
Are you incapable of boiling
an egg?!

446
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,840
The fires are rarely lit,
there is dust everywhere

447
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,520
and you almost destroyed my boots
scraping the mud off them.

448
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,040
If it wasn't my wife's business
to deal with the staff,
I would talk to you myself.

449
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,480
Where is my wife?
Begging your pardon, sir,
but the mistress has gone out.

450
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,720
Out? At this hour of the morning?
Yes, sir.
Did you not know that, sir?

451
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,920
Where did she go?
She's always out these days.

452
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,040
CHUCKLING: Not unlike yourself...sir.

453
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,840
I'm sorry...?

454
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,480
Just observing, sir.
Well, that's quite enough,
nobody asked you to be observant.

455
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Sorry, sir, I just meant
you're hardly ever home together
any more, sir.

456
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,360
You are dangerously close
to impertinence.

457
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,200
I shall have a word with my wife
to have a word with you.

458
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,600
Very good, sir.
And when will you be seeing her?

459
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,320
Now, listen...

460
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,120
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir. A telegram
came for you. You forgot?!

461
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,880
No, I nearly forgot. What have you
been doing all morning?

462
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,400
Reading your new one in The Strand,
sir.

463
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
Did you enjoy it?

464
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,640
Why do you never mention me, sir?

465
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,040
Go away.

466
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,160
The what of the what?
The obliquity of the ecliptic.

467
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,360
"Come at once," you said.
I assumed it was important.

468
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,680
It is.

469
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,080
It's the inclination of the earth's
equator to the path of the sun

470
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,440
on the celestial plane.

471
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,160
CHUCKLING: You been swotting up?
Why would I do that? To sound clever.

472
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,280
I am clever. Oh, oh, I see.
You see what?

473
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,200
I deduce we're on our way to see
someone cleverer than you.

474
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,440
Shut up.

475
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Sh...

476
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Sorry, what? Oh.

477
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,760
To anyone who wishes to study
mankind, this is the spot.

478
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,560
Handy really, as your ever-expanding
backside is permanently glued to it.

479
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,960
Good morning, brother mine.
Sherlock. Dr Watson.

480
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,160
You look...well, sir.

481
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,920
Really?
I rather thought I looked enormous.

482
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,360
Well, now you mention it,
this level of consumption

483
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,000
is incredibly injurious
to your health.

484
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,440
Your heart... No need to worry
on that score, Watson. No?

485
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,920
There's only a large cavity
where that organ should reside.

486
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,880
It's a family trait.
Oh, I wasn't being critical.

487
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
If you continue like this, sir,
I give you five years at the most.

488
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Five? We thought three,
did we not, Sherlock?

489
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,440
I'm still inclined to four.

490
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,360
As ever, you see
but you do not observe.

491
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,920
Note the discolouration
in the whites of my eyes,

492
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,960
the visible rings of fat
around the corneas.

493
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,400
Yes, you're right. I'm changing my
bet to three years, four months
and 11 days. A bet?!

494
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,520
I understand your disapproval,
Watson,

495
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,880
but if he's feeling competitive,
it's perfectly within his power
to die early.

496
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,920
That's a risk you'll have to take.
You're gambling with your own life?

497
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,080
Why not? It's so much more exciting
than gambling with others'.

498
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,640
Three years flat - if you eat that
plum pudding! Done.

499
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
HE GRUNTS

500
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,560
I expected to see you a few days
ago about the Manor House case.

501
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,960
I thought you might be a little
out of your depth there.

502
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,400
No. I solved it.

503
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,880
It was Adams, of course.
Yes, it was Adams.

504
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,480
Murderous jealousy.
He'd written a paper for
the Royal Astronomical Society

505
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,960
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

506
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,360
and then read another that seemed to
surpass it. I know, I read it.

507
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,840
Did you understand it?

508
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,480
Yes, of course I understood it,
it was perfectly simple.

509
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,000
No, did you understand
the murderous jealousy?

510
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,920
It is no easy thing for a great mind
to contemplate a still greater one.

511
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,840
Did you summon me here
just to humiliate me?

512
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,280
Yes.

513
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,600
Of course not, but it is by far
the greater pleasure.

514
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,160
Then would you mind explaining
exactly why you did summon...?

515
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
Our way of life is under threat
from an invisible enemy.

516
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
One that hovers at our elbow
on a daily basis.

517
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,920
These enemies are everywhere...
undetected...and unstoppable.

518
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Socialists?

519
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

520
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,360
Anarchists? No.

521
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,920
The French? The suffragists?

522
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,480
Is there any large body of people
you're not concerned about?

523
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,240
Dr Watson is endlessly vigilant.
Elaborate...

524
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
No. Investigate.

525
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,560
This is a conjecture of mine,
I need you to confirm it.

526
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm sending you a case.

527
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,840
The Scots? The Scots?!

528
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
Are you aware of recent
theories concerning what is

529
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,520
known as paranoia?

530
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,320
Oh, sounds Serbian.

531
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
A woman will call on you -
Lady Carmichael.

532
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,360
I want you to take her case.

533
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,160
But these enemies,
how are we to defeat them

534
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
if you won't tell us about them?

535
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
We don't defeat them.
We most certainly lose to them.

536
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,280
Why?

537
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,960
Because they are right.
And we are wrong.

538
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,240
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

539
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,040
Rest assured,
it has features of interest.

540
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,480
I never really say that.
You really do.

541
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,560
And you've solved it already,
I assume?

542
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,800
Only in my head.
I need you for the, er, legwork.

543
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,640
Why not just tell us your solution?

544
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,240
And where would be
the sport in that?

545
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,520
Will you do it, Sherlock?

546
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,160
I can promise you a superior
distraction.

547
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,360
On one condition.
Have another plum pudding.

548
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,560
There's one on the way.

549
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,640
Two years, 11 months
and four days.

550
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,000
Ha, it's getting exciting now!
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

551
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,960
Thank you, Wilder.

552
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,000
Also, a Mr Melas to see you,
Mr Holmes.

553
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,600
Ah. Give me five minutes,
I have a wager to win.

554
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Better make that 15.

555
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,520
Ticktock.

556
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,560
SQUELCH

557
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,680
Mr Holmes, I have come
here for advice.

558
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,800
That is easily got.
And help.

559
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,720
Not always so easy.

560
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,000
Something has happened, Mr Holmes,
something...unusual

561
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and...terrifying.

562
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,240
Then you are in luck.

563
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,840
SCOFFING: Luck?!

564
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,480
Those are my specialisms.
Hmm, this is really very promising.

565
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,520
Holmes...

566
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,800
Please...do tell us what has
so distressed you.

567
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,680
I, I thought long
and hard as to what to do,

568
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,720
but then it occurred to me
that my husband was

569
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,200
an acquaintance of your brother
and that perhaps through him...

570
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
The fact is, I'm not sure this comes
within your purview, Mr Holmes.

571
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,440
No?

572
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,240
Lord help me, I think
it may be a matter for a priest.

573
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,520
And what does your morning threaten,
my dear?

574
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,440
A vigorous round of embroidering?

575
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,520
An exhausting appointment
at the milliners?

576
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,240
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

577
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,080
HE CHUCKLES

578
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,600
SINISTER SCORE

579
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
What is it?

580
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,320
Eustace?

581
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,880
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

582
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,360
But, Mama...

583
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.

584
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,040
SHE LAUGHS

585
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,640
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

586
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,720
Death.

587
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,440
What?

588
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,760
It means death.

589
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,560
Er, nothing,
it's, er, it's nothing.

590
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,760
I was...mistaken.

591
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,520
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

592
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
It's nothing!

593
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
Eustace...

594
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,920
'Did you keep the envelope?'

595
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,360
My husband destroyed it,
but it was blank.

596
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,560
No name or address of any kind.

597
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,200
Tell me, has Sir Eustace
spent time in America?

598
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,480
No.
Not even before your marriage?

599
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,520
Well, not to my knowledge.
Hmm.

600
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,440
Pray, continue
with your fascinating narrative.

601
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,040
Well, that incident took place
last Monday morning.

602
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,120
It was two days later
on the Wednesday

603
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,640
that my husband first saw her.

604
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
Who?

605
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
Eustace?

606
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,840
HE MOANS

607
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,160
HE WHIMPERS

608
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,760
She's come for me, Louisa!

609
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Oh, God, help me,
my sins have found me out!

610
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,960
Who's come for you?
Eustace, you're frightening me.

611
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,560
Well, look, look!

612
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,280
Don't you see her?

613
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,720
No, I see no-one.

614
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,680
Gone.

615
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,480
HE WAILS

616
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,720
You keep so many secrets from me,
is this another?

617
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,800
Who have you seen?

618
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,800
It was her!

619
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,680
It was the Bride!

620
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,720
And you saw nothing?

621
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,200
Nothing.

622
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,240
Did your husband describe...?
Nothing, until this morning.

623
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,920
Eustace?!

624
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,480
SHE PANTS

625
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,400
Eustace?!

626
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,280
Eustace?

627
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,320
Eustace?!

628
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,800
Argh!

629
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,840
Blast!

630
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
Eustace?!

631
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,000
Where are you? It's me!

632
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,360
# Do not forget me

633
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,760
# Do not forget me

634
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,360
# Remember the maid

635
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,800
# The maid of the mill... #

636
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Who are you?

637
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,960
I demand you speak, who are you?!

638
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,000
Eustace, speak to me.
In the name of God!

639
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,360
She's...

640
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,400
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

641
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,840
No, not you.

642
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
No...

643
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,480
Please!

644
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,840
This night, Eustace Carmichael,
you will die!

645
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
DRAMATIC SCORE BUILDS

646
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,240
HE GROANS

647
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,640
SHE GROANS

648
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,240
Holmes?
Hush, Watson.

649
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,040
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

650
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,600
Well, you know the name?
You must forgive Watson,

651
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,760
he has an enthusiasm for stating
the obvious, which borders on mania.

652
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,920
May I ask,
how is your husband this morning?

653
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,240
He refuses to
speak about the matter.

654
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,080
Obviously, I have urged him to leave
the house. No, no, he must stay
exactly where he is.

655
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,640
Well, you don't think
he's in danger?

656
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,040
Oh, no, somebody definitely wants to
kill him, but that's good for us.
You can't set a trap without bait.

657
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,320
My husband is not bait, Mr Holmes.
No, but he could be
if we play our cards right.

658
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,960
Now, listen,
you must go home immediately.

659
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,000
Dr Watson and I
will follow on the next train.

660
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,840
There's not a moment to lose,
Sir Eustace is to die tonight.
Holmes.

661
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,280
And we should...probably
avoid that.

662
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Definitely.
Definitely avoid that.

663
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,880
Little brother has taken the case,
of course.

664
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,280
I now rely on you to keep
an eye on things,

665
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,800
but he must never suspect
you are working for me.

666
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,720
Are you clear on that, Watson?

667
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
You can rely on me, Mr Holmes.

668
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,320
You don't suppose...
I don't and neither should you.

669
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,960
You don't know what
I was going to say.

670
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,880
You were about to suggest there may
be some supernatural agency

671
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,440
involved in this matter. And I was
about to laugh in your face.

672
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,480
But the Bride, Holmes,
Emelia Ricoletti again.

673
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,440
A dead woman walking the earth.

674
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,120
SIGHING: You amaze me, Watson.
I do?

675
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,600
Since when have you had any
kind of imagination?

676
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,840
Perhaps since I convinced
the reading public that

677
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,600
an unprincipled drug addict was some
kind of gentleman hero.

678
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,760
Yes, now you come to mention it,
that was quite impressive.

679
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,320
You may, however, rest assured
there are no ghosts in this world.

680
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,880
TRAIN WHISTLE

681
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,080
(Save those we make for ourselves.)

682
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,160
Sorry, what did you say?

683
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,360
Ghosts we make for ourselves,
what do you mean?

684
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,080
Somnambulism.

685
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,920
I beg your pardon?

686
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,560
I sleepwalk, that's all.
It's a common enough condition.

687
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,200
I thought you were a doctor!

688
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,480
The whole thing was a...bad dream.

689
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,320
Including the contents
of the envelope you received?

690
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

691
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Well, that's not the impression
you gave your wife, sir.

692
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,360
She's an hysteric, prone to fancies.
No.

693
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,720
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I said no, she's not an hysteric.

694
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,880
She's a highly intelligent
woman of rare perception.

695
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,600
My wife sees terror
in an orange pip.

696
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,880
Your wife can see worlds
where no-one else can see

697
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,400
anything of value whatsoever.

698
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,680
Can she really(?)

699
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,720
And how do you
"deduce" that, Mr Holmes?

700
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,360
She married you.

701
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,200
I assume she was
capable of finding a reason.

702
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,720
I'll do my best to save your life
tonight, but first it would

703
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,560
help if you would explain your
connection to the Ricoletti case.

704
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,120
Ricoletti?

705
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,640
Yes. In detail, please.

706
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,400
I've never heard of her.

707
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,720
Interesting.
I didn't mention she was a woman.

708
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,800
We'll show ourselves out. I hope to
see you again in the morning.

709
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,320
You will not.

710
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,520
Then sadly I shall be
solving your murder. Good day.

711
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,800
Well, you tried.

712
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,120
Will you see that Lady Carmichael
receives this. Thank you.

713
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,360
Good afternoon. Certainly, sir.
What was that?

714
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,400
Lady Carmichael will sleep
alone tonight,

715
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,240
upon the pretence
of a violent headache.

716
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,680
All the doors and windows
of the house will be locked.

717
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,520
Ha!
You think the spectre, er, Bride,

718
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,000
will attempt to lure Sir Eustace
outside again?

719
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,400
Certainly.
Why else the portentous threat?

720
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,440
"This night you will die!"
Well, he won't follow her, surely?

721
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,120
Hmm, it's difficult
to say quite what he'll do.

722
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,920
Guilt is eating away at his soul.
Guilt? About what?

723
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,360
Something in his past.
The orange pips were a reminder.

724
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,600
Not a joke?
Not at all.

725
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Orange pips are a traditional
warning of avenging death,

726
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,280
originating in America.

727
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,520
Sir Eustace knows this
only too well,

728
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,760
just as he knows why
he is to be punished.

729
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,960
Something to do with
Emelia Ricoletti?

730
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,600
I presume. We all have a past,
Watson. Ghosts.

731
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,840
They are the shadows that
define our every sunny day.

732
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,680
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.

733
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,640
There's something more than
murder he fears.

734
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,760
He believes he is to be dragged to
hell by the risen corpse

735
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,160
of the late Mrs Ricoletti.

736
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,000
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

737
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
God, yes.
Did you bring your revolver?

738
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,640
What good would that
be against a ghost?

739
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,480
Exactly. Did you bring it?
Yeah, of course.

740
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,360
Then come, Watson, come.
The game is afoot.

741
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,960
WATSON GROANS

742
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,360
Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake!
Sorry. Cramp.

743
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,440
Is the lamp still burning?
Yes.

744
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,080
There goes Sir Eustace.

745
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,160
And Lady Carmichael.

746
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,520
The house sleeps.

747
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,720
Hmm, good God, this is the longest
night of my life.

748
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,200
Have patience, Watson.

749
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,560
Only midnight.

750
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,080
You know, it's rare for us
to sit together like this.

751
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,680
I should hope so.
It's murder on the knees.

752
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,800
Two old friends just talking.
Chewing the fat.

753
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,560
Man-to-man.

754
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,360
So, a remarkable woman.

755
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,600
Who?
Lady Carmichael.

756
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,800
The fair sex is your department,
Watson.

757
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,320
I'll take your word for it.
Well, you liked her.
"A woman of rare perception."

758
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,640
And admirably high arches.
I noticed them as soon
as she stepped into the room.

759
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,760
Huh, she's far too good for him.
You think so?

760
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,400
No. You think so. I could tell.

761
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,320
On the contrary,
I have no view on the matter.

762
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,920
Yes, you have.

763
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,440
Marriage is not a subject upon which
I dwell. Oh, why not?

764
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
What's the matter with you
this evening?

765
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,440
That watch that you're wearing,
there's a photograph inside it.

766
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,480
I glimpsed it once.
I believe it is of Irene Adler.

767
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,120
You didn't glimpse it,
you waited till I'd fallen asleep

768
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,560
and looked at it. Yes, I did.

769
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,160
You seriously thought I wouldn't
notice? Irene Adler.

770
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
Formidable opponent,
a remarkable adventure.

771
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,400
A very nice photograph.
Why are you talking like this?

772
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,320
Why are you so determined to be
alone? Are you quite well, Watson?

773
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,600
Is it such a curious question?

774
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,080
From a Viennese alienist, no.

775
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,640
From a retired Army surgeon,
most certainly.

776
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,000
Holmes, against absolutely no
opposition whatsoever,

777
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,800
I am your closest friend.
I concede it.

778
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
I am currently attempting to have

779
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,760
a perfectly normal conversation
with you.

780
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,080
Please don't.

781
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,560
Why do you need to be alone?

782
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,000
If you are referring to romantic
entanglement, Watson,

783
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,680
which I rather fear you are,
as I have often explained before,

784
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,080
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

785
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,080
It is the grit in a sensitive
instrument.

786
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,720
The crack in the lens.
The crack in the lens. Yes.

787
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,000
Well, there you are, you see,
I've said it all before.
No, I wrote all that.

788
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,800
You're quoting yourself from
The Strand Magazine. Well, exactly.

789
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,280
Those are my words, not yours!

790
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,520
That is the version of you that
I present to the public.

791
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,560
The brain without a heart.
The calculating machine.

792
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,200
I write all of that, Holmes,
and the readers lap it up.

793
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,920
But I do not believe it.

794
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,320
Well, I've a good mind to write to
your editor. You are a living,
breathing man.

795
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,600
You've lived a life,
you have a past. A what?!

796
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,920
Well, you must have had...

797
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,840
Had what?

798
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
You know.
No.

799
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,040
Experiences.

800
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,600
Pass me your revolver,
I have a sudden need to use it.

801
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,120
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh
and blood, you have feelings,

802
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,480
you have...

803
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,200
You must have... Impulses.

804
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
Dear Lord, I have never been

805
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,440
so impatient to be
attacked by a murderous ghost.

806
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,800
As your friend,
as someone who worries about you...

807
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,120
..what made you like this?

808
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,360
Oh, Watson...

809
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,400
Nothing made me.

810
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,280
DOG YELPS

811
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,560
I made me.

812
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,160
Redbeard?

813
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
Good God!

814
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,680
What are we to do?

815
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,960
Why don't we have a chat?

816
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,120
Mrs Ricoletti, I believe!

817
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,600
A pleasant night
for the time of year, is it not?

818
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,800
It cannot be true, Holmes,
it cannot!

819
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,120
No, it can't.

820
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,480
MAN SCREAMS

821
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,600
GLASS SHATTERS

822
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,600
Is it locked?
As per instruction.

823
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,480
That was a window breaking,
wasn't it?

824
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,680
There's only one broken window
we need concern ourselves with.

825
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,480
Stay here, Watson.
What? No.

826
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,760
All the doors
and windows to the house are locked.

827
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,880
This is their only way out,
I need you here!

828
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,880
But the sound was so close. It had
to be from this side of the house.
Stay here!

829
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,080
WOMAN WAILS

830
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,160
Oh!

831
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,600
No!

832
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,160
You promised to keep him safe.
You promised!

833
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,640
You...

834
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,040
SHE SOBS

835
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,120
CREAKING

836
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,160
BARREL CLICKS

837
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,720
CREAKING

838
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,760
HE STANDS ON GLASS

839
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,360
You're human, I know that.

840
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,040
You must be.

841
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,960
Little use us
standing here in the dark.

842
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,240
After all,
this is the 19th century.

843
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,760
WOMAN SCREAMS

844
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,120
WIND WHISTLES

845
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,440
HE PANTS

846
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,800
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

847
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,400
Do not forget me!

848
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,000
Do not forget me!

849
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,480
SHE WAILS

850
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,560
Watson!

851
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,800
She's there! She's down there! Don't
tell me you abandoned your post!

852
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,600
What? Holmes, she's there,
I saw her!

853
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Empty, thanks to you!

854
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,160
Our bird is flown!

855
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,960
No! No, Holmes, it wasn't
what you think.

856
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,280
I saw her! The ghost!

857
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,040
THERE ARE NO GHOSTS!

858
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,320
What happened? Where is Sir Eustace?

859
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,200
Dead.

860
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,680
You really mustn't blame yourself,
you know.

861
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,760
EXHALES: No, you're quite right.
I'm glad you're seeing sense.

862
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,360
Watson is equally culpable.

863
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,920
Between us, we've managed to
botch this whole case.

864
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,680
I gave an undertaking to
protect that man,

865
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,080
now he's lying there with
a dagger in his breast.

866
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,720
In fact, you gave an undertaking to
investigate his murder.

867
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,920
In the confident expectation
I would not have to!

868
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,600
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

869
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,440
Well, he's been stabbed with
considerable force.

870
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,880
It's a man, then?

871
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,520
Possibly.

872
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,360
A very keen blade, so it could
conceivably have been a woman?

873
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,000
In theory, yes,
but we know who it was, I saw her.

874
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,040
Watson!
I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

875
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,280
You saw nothing! You saw what you
were supposed to see!

876
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
You said yourself,
I have no imagination.

877
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,960
Then use your brain, such as it is,
to eliminate the impossible,

878
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,760
which in this case is the ghost, and
observe what remains, which in this
case is a solution

879
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,600
so blindingly obvious even Lestrade
could work it out! Thank you!

880
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,480
Forget spectres from the other world!

881
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,080
There is only one suspect with
motive and opportunity.

882
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,760
They might as well have left a note.
They did leave a note.

883
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,960
And then there's the matter
of the other broken window.

884
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,240
What other broken window?
Precisely! There isn't one.

885
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,480
The only broken window is the one
that Watson and I entered through,

886
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,800
yet, prior to that, we distinctly
heard the sound of...

887
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,560
What did you just say? Sorry?
About a note, what did you just say?

888
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,280
I said the murderer DID leave
a note. No, they didn't.

889
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,080
There's a message tied to the
dagger. You must have seen it!

890
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,840
There's no message. Yes!

891
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,080
There was no message
when I found the body.

892
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,280
Holmes?

893
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,200
What is it?

894
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,720
Do you?

895
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,120
Do I what?

896
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,320
H-how did you get that?

897
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,040
I left it at the crime scene.

898
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,720
"Crime scene"? Where do you pick up
these extraordinary expressions?

899
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,480
Do you miss him?

900
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,840
Moriarty is dead.

901
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,160
And yet...?

902
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,280
His body was never recovered.

903
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,560
To be expected when one pushes
a maths professor over a waterfall.

904
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,360
Pure reason toppled by sheer
melodrama.

905
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,960
Your life in a nutshell.

906
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,440
Where do you pick up these
extraordinary expressions?

907
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,080
HE SNIFFS
Have you put on weight?

908
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,720
You saw me only yesterday.
Does that seem possible?

909
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,960
No.

910
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,800
Yet here I am, increased.

911
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,240
What does that tell the foremost
criminal investigator in England?

912
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,680
In England?

913
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,000
You're in deep, Sherlock,
deeper than you ever intended to be.

914
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,360
Have you made a list? Of what?

915
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,960
Everything.
We will need a list.

916
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,280
Good boy.

917
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,160
No, I haven't finished yet.

918
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,320
Moriarty may beg to differ.

919
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,840
HE SIGHS

920
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,040
He's trying to distract me.
To derail me.

921
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,720
Yes.

922
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,920
He's the crack in the lens,
the fly in the ointment,

923
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,680
the virus in the data.

924
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,840
I have to finish this.

925
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,120
If Moriarty has risen
from the Reichenbach cauldron,

926
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,400
he will seek you out.

927
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,560
I'll be waiting.

928
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,320
Yes.

929
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,760
I'm very much afraid you will.

930
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
(Two days he's been like that.)

931
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,040
(Has he eaten?)

932
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,320
No, not a morsel.

933
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,240
Press are having a ruddy field day.
There's still reporters outside.

934
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,320
Oh, they've been there all the time,
I can't get rid of them.

935
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,320
I've been rushed off my feet
making tea.

936
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,120
Why do you make him tea?

937
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,080
I dunno, I just sort of do.

938
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,240
He said, "There's only one suspect,"
and then he just walks away

939
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,440
and now he won't explain.

940
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,560
Which is strange,
because he likes that bit.

941
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,160
Said it was
so simple I could solve it.

942
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,840
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

943
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
What's he doing, do you think?

944
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,640
He says he's waiting.
For what?

945
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,280
The devil. I wouldn't be surprised.

946
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,160
We get all sorts here.

947
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,240
Well, wire me if there's any change.
Yeah.

948
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,400
CREAKING

949
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,120
FOOTSTEPS

950
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,920
Everything I have to say has
already crossed your mind.

951
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,760
Then possibly my answer has
crossed yours.

952
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,200
Like a bullet.

953
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,080
It's a dangerous habit,

954
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,440
to finger loaded firearms in the
pocket of one's dressing gown.

955
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,840
Or are you just pleased to see me?

956
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,560
NECK CREAKS

957
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,960
You'll forgive me
for taking precautions.

958
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,200
I'd be offended if you didn't.

959
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,400
Obviously, I've returned
the courtesy.

960
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,440
BARREL CLICKS

961
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,120
I like your rooms. They smell so...

962
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,040
..manly.

963
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,960
I'm sure you acquainted yourself
with them before now.

964
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,840
Well, you are always away, on your
little adventures for The Strand.

965
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,640
Tell me, does the illustrator
travel with you?

966
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,520
Do you have to pose...
during your deductions?

967
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,880
I'm aware of all six occasions you
have visited these apartments

968
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,560
during my absence.
I know you are.

969
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,440
By the way, you have
a surprisingly comfortable bed.

970
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,560
Did you know that dust is largely
composed of human skin?

971
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,160
Yes.

972
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,680
Doesn't taste the same, though,
you want your skin fresh.

973
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,320
Just a little crispy.
Won't you sit down?

974
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,400
That's all people really are,
you know,

975
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,160
dust waiting to be distributed.

976
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,920
And it gets everywhere. Ugh.

977
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,680
In every breath you take,
dancing in every sunbeam,

978
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,080
all the used-up people.

979
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,600
Fascinating, I'm sure.
Won't you sit...

980
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,520
People, people, people!
Can't keep anything shiny.

981
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,600
Do you mind if I fire this?

982
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,400
Just to clean it out.

983
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,520
Exactly, let's stop playing.

984
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,360
We don't need toys to
kill each other.

985
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,040
Where's the intimacy in that?
Sit down.

986
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,360
Why? What do you want?
You chose to come here.

987
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,520
Not true, you know that's not true.

988
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,880
What do you want, Sherlock?

989
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,280
The truth.

990
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,560
That. Truth's boring!

991
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,720
You didn't expect me to turn up
at the scene of the crime, did you?

992
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,920
Poor old Sir Eustace.
He got what was coming to him.

993
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,560
But you couldn't have killed him.

994
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,040
Oh, so what? Does it matter?
Stop it. Stop this.

995
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,800
You don't care about Sir Eustace,
or the Bride, or any of it.

996
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,280
There's only one thing in this whole
business that you find interesting.

997
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,760
(I know what you're doing.)

998
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,800
RATTLING

999
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,600
The Bride put a gun in her mouth
and shot the back of her head off

1000
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,840
and then she came back.

1001
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,720
Impossible. But she did it.

1002
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,320
And you need to know how.

1003
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,600
How?

1004
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,240
Don't you?

1005
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,440
It's tearing your world apart,
not knowing.

1006
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,520
You're trying to stop me...
To distract me, derail me.

1007
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,760
Because doesn't this remind
you of another case?

1008
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,160
Hasn't this all happened before?

1009
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,640
There's nothing new under the sun.
What was it?

1010
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,360
What was it?
What was that case? Huh?

1011
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,800
Do you remember?

1012
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,280
(It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the tip of my tongue.)

1013
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,520
(It's on the tip of my tongue.)

1014
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,040
(It's on the tip...)

1015
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,160
(..of my tongue.)

1016
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,080
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's
wallpaper, I must remind you

1017
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,680
that one false move with your finger
and you will be dead.

1018
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,240
HE MUMBLES

1019
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,640
I'm sorry?

1020
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,120
Dead...(is the new sexy.)

1021
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,400
RUMBLING

1022
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,320
GUNSHOT

1023
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,800
Well, I'll tell you what,
that rather blows the cobwebs away.

1024
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,520
(How can you be alive?)

1025
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,320
How do I look?

1026
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,880
Huh?

1027
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,400
You can be honest, is it noticeable?

1028
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,600
You blew your own brains out,
how could you survive?

1029
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,120
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1030
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,240
I saw you die.

1031
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,600
Why aren't you dead?

1032
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,440
Because it's not the fall that
kills you, Sherlock.

1033
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,640
Of all people, you should know that,
it's not the fall,

1034
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,760
it's never the fall.

1035
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,360
It's the landing!

1036
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,200
RATTLING

1037
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,560
TYRES SCREECH

1038
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,720
We've landed, sir.

1039
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,440
We've landed.

1040
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,080
No, no, not now, not now!

1041
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,400
Not now, not now.

1042
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,200
I trust you had
a pleasant flight, sir?

1043
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,960
MYCROFT: Well,
a somewhat shorter exile

1044
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,440
than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1045
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,480
but probably adequate,
given your levels of OCD.

1046
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,800
I have to go back! What?

1047
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,640
I was...I was nearly there,
I nearly had it!

1048
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,240
What on earth are you talking about?

1049
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,000
Go back where?
You didn't get very far.

1050
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,720
Ricoletti and his abominable wife!
Don't you understand?!

1051
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,400
No, of course we don't, you're
not making any sense, Sherlock.

1052
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,640
It was a case, a famous one
from 100 years ago.

1053
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,960
Lodged in my hard drive, she seemed
to be dead, but then she came back.

1054
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,000
What, like Moriarty? Shot herself
in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1055
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,440
But you've only just been told.

1056
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,480
We've only just found out, he's on
every TV screen in the country.

1057
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,880
Yes? So? It's been five minutes
since Mycroft called.

1058
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,160
What progress have you made?
What have you been doing?

1059
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,080
More to the point,
what have YOU been doing?

1060
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,240
I've been in my Mind Palace,
of course. Of course.

1061
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,880
Running an experiment.
How would I have solved the crime,

1062
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,880
if I'd been there in 1895?
Oh, Sherlock.

1063
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,160
I had all the details perfect.

1064
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,360
I was there, all of it, everything.
I was immersed.

1065
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,600
Of course you were.

1066
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,840
You've been reading John's blog.
The story of how you met.

1067
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,280
It helps me if I see myself
through his eyes sometimes.

1068
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,640
I'm so much cleverer.

1069
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,600
Do you really think
anyone is believing you?

1070
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,000
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1071
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,160
The Mind Palace,
it's like a whole world in his head.

1072
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,240
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1073
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,880
The Mind Palace is a memory
technique, I know what it can do

1074
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,680
and I know what it most
certainly cannot.

1075
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,120
Maybe there are one or two things
that I know that you don't.

1076
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Oh, there are.

1077
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,320
Did you make a list?

1078
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,160
You've put on weight. That waistcoat
is clearly newer than the jacket.

1079
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,400
Stop this! Just stop it!
Did you make a list?! Of what?

1080
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,520
Everything, Sherlock.
Everything you've taken.

1081
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,400
No, it's not that, he goes into a
sort of trance. I've seen him do it.

1082
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,040
PAPER FLUTTERS

1083
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,000
We have an agreement, my brother
and I, ever since that day.

1084
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,480
GASPING

1085
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,720
Wherever I find him,

1086
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,160
whatever back alley or doss-house...

1087
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,040
..there will always be a list.

1088
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,280
He couldn't have taken all that
in the last five minutes.

1089
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,920
He was high before
he got on the plane.

1090
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,680
He didn't seem high.

1091
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,040
Nobody deceives like an addict.

1092
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,440
I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1093
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,120
I alleviate boredom and occasionally
heighten my thought processes.

1094
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,920
For God's sake! This could kill you!

1095
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,600
You could die! Controlled usage
is not usually fatal

1096
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,960
and abstinence is not immortality.

1097
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,200
What are you doing?

1098
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,720
Emelia Ricoletti,
I'm looking her up.

1099
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,280
Oh, I suppose we should.

1100
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,880
I have access to the top level
of the MI5 archive.

1101
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,720
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1102
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,960
What do you think of MI5 security?

1103
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,400
I think it would be a good idea.

1104
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,520
Emelia Ricoletti,
"unsolved", like he says.

1105
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,560
Could you all just shut up
for five minutes!

1106
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,760
I have to go back.

1107
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,800
I was nearly there before you
stepped on and started yapping away!

1108
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,080
"Yapping?" Sorry, did we
interrupt your session?

1109
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,320
Sherlock, listen to me.

1110
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,760
No, it only encourages you.

1111
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,720
I'm not angry with you.
Oh, that's a relief(!)

1112
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,800
I was really worried...
No, hold on,

1113
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,080
I really wasn't.

1114
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,760
I was there for you before.

1115
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,240
I'll be there for you again.

1116
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,960
I'll always be there for you.

1117
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,320
This was my fault.

1118
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,120
It was nothing to do with you.

1119
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,920
A week in a prison cell, I should
have realised. Realised what?

1120
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,080
That, in your case,

1121
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,640
solitary confinement is locking
you up with your worst enemy.

1122
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,760
Oh, for God's sake!

1123
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,920
Morphine or cocaine?

1124
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,200
What did you say?

1125
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,720
I didn't say anything.

1126
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,640
No, you did, you said...

1127
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,080
IN WATSON'S VOICE: 'Which is it
today? Morphine or cocaine.'

1128
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,160
'Holmes?'

1129
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,600
Morphine or cocaine -
which is it today?

1130
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,200
DOOR SLAMS
Answer me, damn it!

1131
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,800
SLUGGISHLY: Moriarty was here.

1132
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,880
Moriarty's dead.

1133
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,520
I was on a jet.

1134
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,760
A what?

1135
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,320
You were there, and Mycroft.

1136
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,520
You haven't left these rooms,
Holmes.

1137
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,520
You...haven't...moved.

1138
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,560
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1139
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,280
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1140
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,400
Would you care to try it? No.

1141
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,720
But I would quite like to find
every ounce of the stuff

1142
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,000
in your possession
and pour it out of the window.

1143
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,640
I should be inclined to stop you.

1144
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,440
Then you would be reminded,
quite forcibly,

1145
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,920
which of us is a soldier
and which of us a drug addict.

1146
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,880
You're not a soldier,
you are a doctor.

1147
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,960
I'm an army doctor,

1148
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,000
which means I could break every bone
in your body while naming them.

1149
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,800
My dear Watson, you are allowing
emotion to cloud your judgment.

1150
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,720
Never on a case.

1151
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,480
You promised me, never on a case.

1152
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,880
No, I just said that in
one of your stories. Listen,

1153
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,720
I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1154
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,560
I will run along behind you
like some halfwit,

1155
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,680
making you look clever,
if that's what you need.

1156
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,280
But dear God above, you will hold
yourself to a higher standard!

1157
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
Why? Because people need you to.

1158
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,440
What people, why?
Because of your idiot stories?

1159
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,680
Yes, because of my "idiot stories".

1160
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,440
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
Mr Holmes!

1161
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,280
Mr Holmes, telegram, Mr Holmes.

1162
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,200
What is it? What's wrong?

1163
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,520
It's Mary. Mary? What about her?

1164
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,960
It's entirely possible
she's in danger. Danger?

1165
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,640
There's not a moment to lose.

1166
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,960
Is this the cocaine talking?

1167
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,240
What danger could Mary be in?

1168
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,240
I'm sure she's just visiting
with friends. Come on!

1169
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,360
What is happening?

1170
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,640
Are you even in a fit state?

1171
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,800
For Mary, of course.
Never doubt that, Watson.

1172
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,720
Never that.

1173
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,200
HOLMES GROANS
Holmes?

1174
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,400
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1175
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,560
Not that one!

1176
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,640
This one.

1177
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,160
Why? You're Sherlock Holmes.
Wear the damn hat.

1178
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,000
Cab! Cab!

1179
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,680
So tell me, where is she?

1180
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,720
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1181
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,000
Oh, good old Watson(!)

1182
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,560
How would we fill the time
if you didn't ask questions?!

1183
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,080
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody
wife is, you pompous prick,

1184
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,640
or I'll punch your lights out!

1185
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,480
Holmes, where is she?

1186
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,560
A de-sanctified church.

1187
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,680
She thinks she's found the solution
and, for no better reason than that,

1188
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,440
she's put herself in the path
of considerable danger.

1189
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,240
What an excellent choice of wife.

1190
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,880
What the devil?!

1191
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,160
I've found them.

1192
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,040
CHANTING

1193
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,680
What is all this, Mary?
This is the heart of it all, John.

1194
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,360
The heart of the conspiracy.

1195
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,800
CHANTING CONTINUES

1196
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,800
FIGURES CHANT IN LATIN

1197
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,760
Great God, what is this place?

1198
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,760
And what the devil
are you doing here?!

1199
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,120
I've been making enquiries.

1200
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,760
Mr Holmes asked me.

1201
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,040
Holmes, how could you?

1202
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,560
No, not him, the clever one.

1203
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,280
It seemed obvious to me that this
business could not be managed alone.

1204
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,880
My theory is that
Mrs Ricoletti had help.

1205
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,320
Help from her friends.

1206
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,360
Bravo, Mary. "The clever one?" I...

1207
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,960
I thought I was losing you.

1208
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,680
I thought perhaps we were...

1209
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,040
neglecting each other.
Well, you're the one who moved out.

1210
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,280
I was talking to Mary.

1211
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,560
You're working for Mycroft?

1212
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,600
He likes to keep an eye
on his mad sibling.

1213
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,040
And he had a spy to hand.
Has it never occurred to you

1214
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,280
your wife is excessively skilled
for a nurse? Of course it hasn't,

1215
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,640
because he knows what
a nurse is capable of.

1216
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,880
When did it occur to you?
Only now, I'm afraid.

1217
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,760
Must be difficult,

1218
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,440
being the slow little brother.

1219
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,960
Time I sped up. Enough chatter,
let's concentrate.

1220
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,040
Yes, all right.
What's all this about?

1221
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,720
What do they want to accomplish?
Why don't we go and find out.

1222
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,360
CHANTING CONTINUES

1223
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,560
GONG CRASHES

1224
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,560
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1225
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,480
Or a touch of the dramatic.
Never have guessed(!)

1226
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,600
Though it seems you share
my enthusiasm in that regard.

1227
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,800
Excellent.

1228
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,080
Superlative theatre.

1229
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,120
I applaud the spectacle.

1230
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,120
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1231
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,360
then apparently returned from
the grave and killed her husband.

1232
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,400
So...

1233
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,640
how was it done?

1234
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,520
Let's take the events in order.

1235
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,400
Mrs Ricoletti gets everyone's
attention in very efficient fashion.

1236
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,000
You!

1237
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
GUNFIRE CONTINUES

1238
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You?!

1239
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,640
Or me?

1240
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,640
She places one of the
revolvers in her mouth,

1241
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,920
while actually firing
the other into the ground.

1242
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,840
An accomplice sprays
the curtains with blood

1243
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,320
and thus her apparent suicide

1244
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,800
is witnessed by
the frightened crowd below.

1245
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,240
A substitute corpse, bearing a strong
resemblance to Mrs Ricoletti

1246
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,880
takes her place and is
later transported to the morgue,

1247
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,200
a grubby little suicide of little
interest to Scotland Yard.

1248
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,800
Meanwhile,
the real Mrs Ricoletti slips away.

1249
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,360
Now comes the really clever part.

1250
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,200
Mrs Ricoletti persuaded a cab
driver, someone who knew her,

1251
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,680
to intercept her husband outside
his favourite opium den.

1252
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,960
The perfect stage
for a perfect drama.

1253
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,600
Who are you? What do you want?

1254
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,320
Emelia?

1255
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,560
MAN: Help!

1256
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,720
A perfect positive identification.

1257
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,000
The late Mrs Ricoletti
has returned from the grave

1258
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,920
and a little skilled make-up

1259
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,520
and you have nothing less than
the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1260
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,160
There was only one thing left to do.

1261
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,800
Swiftly now. No tears.

1262
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,680
GUNSHOT

1263
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,400
All that remained was to substitute
the real Mrs Ricoletti

1264
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,080
for the corpse in the morgue.

1265
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,920
This time, should anyone
attempt to identify her,

1266
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,400
it would be positively,
absolutely her.

1267
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,440
MARY: But why would she do that?

1268
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,880
Die to prove a point?

1269
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,240
Every great cause has martyrs.

1270
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:24,800
Every war has suicide missions
and make no mistake, this is war.

1271
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,320
One half of the human race
at war with the other.

1272
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,280
The invisible army
hovering at our elbow,

1273
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,320
tending to our homes,

1274
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,520
raising our children.

1275
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,400
Ignored, patronised,

1276
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,920
disregarded.

1277
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,560
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1278
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,400
But an army nonetheless,

1279
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,440
ready to rise up in
the best of causes.

1280
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,360
To put right an injustice
as old as humanity itself.

1281
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,640
So you see, Watson,
Mycroft was right.

1282
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,480
This is a war we must lose.

1283
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,680
She was dying.

1284
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,280
Who was? Emelia Ricoletti.

1285
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,040
There were clear signs
of consumption -

1286
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,840
I doubt she was long for this world.

1287
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,840
So she decided to make
her death count.

1288
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,160
She was already familiar with
the secret societies of America.

1289
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,000
And was able to draw on
their methods of fear

1290
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,440
and intimidation to publicly,
very publicly,

1291
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,640
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael
with the sins of his past.

1292
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,440
He knew her out in the States.

1293
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,520
Promised her everything.

1294
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,560
Marriage, position.

1295
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,960
And then he had his way with her...

1296
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,880
..and threw her over.

1297
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,920
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1298
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,960
Hooper!

1299
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,680
Holmes.

1300
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,040
For the record, Holmes,
she didn't have me fooled.

1301
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,200
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1302
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,800
Emelia thought that she'd found
happiness with Ricoletti,

1303
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,080
but he was a brute too.

1304
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,640
RAPID SPEECH

1305
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,920
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1306
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,520
You have no idea how
that bastard treated her.

1307
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,680
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1308
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,800
Yes, Watson, we did.

1309
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,840
The sound of breaking glass?

1310
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,720
Not a window,

1311
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,960
just an old theatrical trick.

1312
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,160
It cannot be true, Holmes,
it cannot! No, it can't.

1313
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,600
'It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1314
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,800
'A simple reflection in glass
of a living, breathing person.

1315
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,760
'Their only mistake was breaking
the glass when they removed it.'

1316
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,320
Look around you.

1317
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,480
This room is full of brides.

1318
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,400
Once she had risen,

1319
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,760
anyone could be her.

1320
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,120
The avenging ghost.

1321
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,800
A legend to strike terror
into the heart of any man

1322
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,800
with malicious intent.

1323
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,400
A spectre to stalk
those unpunished brutes

1324
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,400
whose reckoning is long overdue.

1325
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,520
A league of furies awakened.

1326
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,120
The women I...

1327
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,760
WE have lied to, betrayed.

1328
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,600
The women we have ignored
and disparaged.

1329
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,800
Once the idea exists,

1330
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,920
it cannot be killed.

1331
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,320
This is the work of
a single-minded person.

1332
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,760
Someone who knew first-hand about
Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1333
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,080
The dark secret,

1334
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,200
kept from all but
her closest friends,

1335
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,840
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1336
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,320
..the woman her husband wronged
all those years before.

1337
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,480
If one disregards the ghost,

1338
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,000
there is only one suspect.

1339
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,680
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1340
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,520
One small detail doesn't quite
make sense to me, however.

1341
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,840
Why engage me to prevent a murder
you intended to commit?

1342
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,960
Hmm?

1343
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,120
MORIARTY: "Doesn't quite make sense,
doesn't quite make sense."

1344
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,520
Of course it doesn't make sense,
it's not real.

1345
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,640
HE SCOFFS

1346
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,000
Oh, Sherlock.

1347
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,680
SHERLOCK EXHALES SHARPLY
Peek-a-boo.

1348
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,000
No.

1349
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,760
No, not you.

1350
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,160
It can't be you.

1351
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,720
I mean, come on, be serious.

1352
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,280
The costumes, the gong?

1353
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,320
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1354
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,120
we don't really have gongs
or special outfits.

1355
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,400
What the hell is going on?

1356
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,640
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1357
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,320
Gothic enough?
Mad enough, even for you?

1358
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,800
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock,

1359
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,920
because it's not real.

1360
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,640
None of it.
What's he talking about?

1361
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,240
This is all in your mind.

1362
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,800
Sherlock?

1363
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,560
Holmes!

1364
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,280
You're dreaming.

1365
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,800
Argh!
MARY: Is he dreaming?

1366
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,720
MYCROFT: And there he is.

1367
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,400
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1368
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,560
May I just check, is this what
you mean by "controlled usage"?

1369
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,520
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti, I need
to know where she was buried.

1370
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,040
What, 120 years ago? Yes.

1371
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,040
That would take weeks to find,
if those records even exists.

1372
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,200
Even with my resources. Got it.

1373
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,480
I don't get it,
how is this relevant?

1374
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,400
I need to know I was right,
then I'll be sure.

1375
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,720
You mean how Moriarty did it? Yes.

1376
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,040
But none of that really happened,
it was in your head.

1377
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,520
My investigation was the fantasy,

1378
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,360
the crime happened
exactly as I explained.

1379
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,400
The stone was erected
by a group of her friends.

1380
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,000
I don't know what you think
you'll find here. I need to try!

1381
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,960
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here,
but what happened to the other one?

1382
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,000
The corpse they substituted for her
after the so-called suicide?

1383
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,200
They'd move it, of course
they would. But where?

1384
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,880
Well, not here.

1385
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,200
But that... That's exactly
what they must have done.

1386
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,160
The conspirators had
someone on the inside.

1387
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,160
They found a body, just like Molly
Hooper found a body for me, when...

1388
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,520
Yeah, well, we don't need to
go into all that again, do we?

1389
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,240
You're not seriously
going to do this?

1390
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,400
It's why we came here.
I need to know.

1391
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,840
Spoken like an addict.

1392
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,280
This is important to me!

1393
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,680
No, this is you needing a fix.

1394
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,080
John... Moriarty's back.

1395
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,400
We have a case, we have
a real-life problem right now.

1396
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,840
Getting to that, it's next on
the list. Just let me do this.

1397
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,080
No, everyone always lets
you do whatever you want.

1398
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,400
That's how you got in this state!
John, please...

1399
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,160
I'm not playing this time,
Sherlock. Not any more!

1400
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,160
When you're ready to go to work,
give me a call.

1401
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,000
I'm taking Mary home. You're what?

1402
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,800
Mary's taking me home. Better.

1403
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,120
He's right, you know.
So what if he's right?!

1404
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,280
He's always right, it's boring!

1405
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,560
Will you help me?

1406
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,960
Cherchez la femme.

1407
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,600
THEY GRUNT AND STRAIN

1408
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,040
LOUD BUMP

1409
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,560
LESTRADE GRUNTS

1410
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,640
Eurgh!

1411
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,040
Oh, dear.

1412
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,360
The cupboard is bare.

1413
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,600
They must have buried it underneath.

1414
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,280
They must have buried it
underneath the coffin.

1415
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,520
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1416
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,960
Maybe they got rid of
the body in another way.

1417
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,440
No... More than likely.

1418
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,280
At any rate,
it was a very long time ago.

1419
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,640
We do have slightly more pressing
matters to hand, little brother.

1420
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,960
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1421
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:52,000
FAINT, RASPING FEMALE VOICE:
'Do not forget me.

1422
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,640
'Do not forget me!'

1423
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,480
CREAKING

1424
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,800
SCREECHING

1425
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,120
SHERLOCK GASPS

1426
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,840
CRASHING WATER
This?

1427
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,960
Oh, I see.

1428
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,360
Still not awake, am I?

1429
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,680
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1430
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,040
Congratulations,
you will be the first man in history

1431
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,960
to be buried in his own Mind Palace.

1432
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,840
The setting is a shade melodramatic,
don't you think?

1433
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,160
For you and me?

1434
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,680
Not at all.

1435
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,520
What are you?

1436
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,680
You know what I am.

1437
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,360
I'm Moriarty.

1438
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,000
The Napoleon of Crime.

1439
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,440
Moriarty's dead! Not in your mind.

1440
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,880
I'll never be dead there.

1441
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,640
You once called your brain
a hard drive.

1442
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,160
Well, say hello to the virus.

1443
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,000
This is how we end, you and I.

1444
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,360
Always here,

1445
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,560
always together.

1446
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,320
You have a magnificent brain,
Moriarty.

1447
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,200
I admire it.

1448
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,840
I concede it may even be
the equal of my own.

1449
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,120
I'm touched.

1450
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,920
I'm honoured.

1451
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,440
But when it comes to the
matter of unarmed combat

1452
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,920
on the edge of a precipice...

1453
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,240
..you're going in the water,

1454
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,480
short-arse.

1455
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,480
MORIARTY HISSES, SHERLOCK CHOKES

1456
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,560
THEY GRUNT

1457
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,920
Oh, you think you're so big
and strong, Sherlock!

1458
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,120
Not with me.

1459
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,000
SHERLOCK GRUNTS

1460
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,240
THEY GRUNT AND GASP

1461
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,320
I am your weakness!

1462
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,960
I keep you down!

1463
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,960
Every time you stumble,
every time you fail,

1464
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,480
when you're weak,

1465
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,680
I...am...

1466
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,120
there!

1467
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,160
No,

1468
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,720
don't try to fight it.

1469
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,240
Lie back and lose!

1470
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,600
Shall we go over together?

1471
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,360
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1472
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,720
At the end it's always just you

1473
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,480
and me!

1474
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,920
WATSON CLEARS HIS THROAT

1475
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,960
PISTOL COCKS

1476
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,640
Professor, if you wouldn't mind
stepping away from my friend,

1477
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,840
I do believe he finds your
attention a shade annoying.

1478
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,600
That's not fair, there's two of you!

1479
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,600
There's always two of us.
Don't you read The Strand?

1480
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,120
On your knees, Professor.

1481
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,960
Hands behind your head.

1482
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,480
Thank you, John.

1483
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,120
Since when do you call me John?

1484
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,720
You'd be surprised.

1485
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,920
No, I wouldn't.

1486
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,960
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1487
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,640
I'm a story-teller,
I know when I'm in one.

1488
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,440
Of course.

1489
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,680
Of course you do, John.

1490
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,200
So what's he like?

1491
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,560
The other me in the other place?

1492
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,800
Smarter than he looks.

1493
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,240
Pretty damn smart, then.

1494
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,120
Pretty damn smart.

1495
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,720
Ugh, why don't you two just elope,
for God's sake?!

1496
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,560
Impertinent.

1497
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,200
Offensive.

1498
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,880
Actually, would you mind?

1499
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,960
Not at all.

1500
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,200
MORIARTY SCREAMS

1501
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,240
It was my turn. Quite so.

1502
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,760
So how do you plan to wake up?

1503
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,520
Oh...

1504
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,920
I should think like this.

1505
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,600
Are you sure?

1506
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,720
Between you and me, John,
I always survive a fall.

1507
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,840
But how?

1508
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,080
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1509
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,360
HE GASPS

1510
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,040
Miss me?
Sherlock, are you all right?

1511
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,680
Yes. Of course I am,
why wouldn't I be?

1512
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,320
Because you probably just OD'd.
You should be in hospital.

1513
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,160
Hm, no time.

1514
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,440
I have to go to Baker Street now,
Moriarty's back.

1515
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,760
I almost hope he is,

1516
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,200
if it'll save you from this.

1517
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,080
No need for that now,

1518
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,640
I've got the real thing.

1519
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,240
I have work to do. Sherlock...

1520
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,160
..promise me.

1521
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,480
What are you still doing here?

1522
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,800
Shouldn't you be off getting me
a pardon or something,

1523
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,080
like a proper big brother?

1524
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,480
Dr Watson...

1525
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,880
Look after him.

1526
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,920
Please.

1527
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,520
Sherlock, hang on, explain.
Moriarty's alive, then?

1528
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,640
I never said he was alive,
I said he was back.

1529
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,080
So he's dead?

1530
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:34,440
Of course he's dead, he blew his own
brains out, no-one survives that.

1531
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,920
I just went to the trouble
of an overdose to prove it.

1532
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,280
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1533
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,360
But more importantly, I know exactly
what he's going to do next.

1534
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,600
THEME TUNE BEGINS

1535
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,120
THEME TUNE JUDDERS TO HALT

1536
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,120
Flying machines,

1537
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,600
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1538
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,240
What sort of lunatic
fantasy is that?

1539
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,160
It was simply my conjecture of what
a future world might look like

1540
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,600
and how you and I might
fit inside it.

1541
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,880
From a drop of water a logician
should be able to infer

1542
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,400
the possibility of
an Atlantic or a Niagara.

1543
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,000
Or a Reichenbach?

1544
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,280
Have you written up your
account of the case? Yes.

1545
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,960
Hmm.

1546
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,880
Modified to put it down as one of my
rare failures, of course? Of course.

1547
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,720
The Adventure Of...

1548
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,000
The Invisible Army.

1549
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,120
The League Of Furies?

1550
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,320
The Monstrous Regiment?

1551
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,120
I rather thought
The Abominable Bride.

1552
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,360
A trifle lurid. It'll sell.
It's got proper murders in it too.

1553
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,600
You're the expert.

1554
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,720
As for your own tale,

1555
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,360
are you sure it's still just
a 7% solution that you take?

1556
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,560
I think you may have
increased the dosage.

1557
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,560
Perhaps I was being
a little fanciful.

1558
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,240
But perhaps such things
could come to pass.

1559
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,320
In any case, I know I would be
very much at home in such a world.

1560
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,880
Huh, I don't think I would be.
I beg to differ.

1561
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,600
But then I've always known
I was a man out of his time.
